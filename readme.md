# StoryBooks

An app to post public and private stories to share with others or keep a personal diary 📝 A Node.js practice webapp I'm building following @traversymedia's Node.js Udemy course 💻

Part of my #100DaysOfCode project. If you're interested, follow me on Twitter @ericnmurphy, I post lots of cool shit ✨

Finished this one for now, catch it (for now) on https://shrouded-hollows-95114.herokuapp.com
